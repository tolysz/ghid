I guess this is a historical repo; maybe I will refactor it to use `modern haskell` and use stuff
I learned since writing it.

This was a first `big` tool I made in haskell. It generated one kernel bugfix :).

It, with a kernel patch, allows to do dynamically reasign how raw device events are interpreted by the linux kernel.
OR it makes it very easy to create firmware for your own special device.
