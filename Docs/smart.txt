Smart is a language for modifying descriptors, it is really more 
simmilar to an assembler than to anything else as it is designed to 
mirror the standard descriptor using more meaningfull keywords
and by removing the need to worry about convertion of numbers to the right
format or worying about the right length for encoding them.
There is still a need to understand what are you exactlly doing thus it is not a trivial task, 
however it is much easier then playing with pure descriptor.

Case is not important as is the formatting. Most of these keywords are usually followed by a number.

Numbers can be writen in signed decimal or hexadecimal(prefixed by 0x)

corresponds to values for UP and those from inside to U.
